README for Age of Learning Pilot Data Analysis Submission

Project Title

Age of Learning Pilot Data Analysis - Nick Peralez - Senior Product Analyst Candidate

Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Senior Product Analyst position at Age of Learning. It showcases a comprehensive analysis of the provided pilot program data, which aimed to evaluate the impact of My Math Academy and My Reading Academy on student engagement and skill growth. This project combines Python scripts, Tableau visualizations, and a polished presentation to communicate key insights and actionable recommendations for a district-wide program rollout.

Contents
	1.	Presentation:
	•	File: Age of Learning Pilot Data Analysis - Nick Peralez - Senior Product Analyst.pptx
	•	Description: A professional, customer-facing presentation summarizing the pilot’s outcomes, engagement trends, skill growth analysis, and actionable recommendations. Designed for a 20-25 minute discussion with time for Q&A.
	2.	Python Analysis:
	•	File: AOFL_Interview.ipynb
	•	Description: Jupyter Notebook containing:
	•	Data Cleaning: Removal of duplicates, filling null values, and creating cleaned_data.csv.
	•	Exploration and Analysis: Metrics like total skills mastered, percentage skill growth, and usage patterns.
	•	Visualizations: Scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts, and outlier identification to provide deeper insights.
	3.	Tableau Workbook:
	•	File: Tableau AOFL.twb
	•	Description: Tableau visualizations to validate Python analysis and create additional interactive dashboards.
	•	Note: Tabs marked in red indicate areas where differences between Tableau and Python results exist. These discrepancies were not fully resolved due to time constraints but should not impact overall conclusions.
	4.	Cleaned Data:
	•	File: cleaned_data.csv
	•	Description: Final dataset resulting from data cleaning and preprocessing in Python. This dataset was used consistently in both Python and Tableau analyses.
	5.	Raw Data:
	•	Files:
	•	Age of Learning Student Usage.csv
	•	Age of Learning Student Dimensions.csv
	•	Age of Learning Skills by Domain.csv
	•	Description: Raw datasets provided for analysis.
	6.	Project Instructions:
	•	File: Age of Learning Analytics Update Dec 2024.docx
	•	Description: Original project guidelines and data dictionary outlining key metrics, objectives, and the purpose of the pilot program analysis.

Key Highlights
	1.	Data Cleaning and Preparation:
	•	Addressed duplicates and missing values.
	•	Created additional metrics, such as skills_mastered_per_week and total_skill_growth.
	2.	Key Insights:
	•	Engagement: Strong weekly logins and active participation during the pilot.
	•	Skill Growth: Exceptional performance in high-impact domains like Measurement, with areas for improvement in foundational language.
	•	Outliers: Identified and analyzed students with high growth but low usage and those with low growth despite high usage.
	3.	Actionable Recommendations:
	•	Increase post-placement engagement.
	•	Refine curricula in low-performing domains.
	•	Monitor outliers for targeted interventions.

How to Use
	1.	Presentation:
	•	Open Age of Learning Pilot Data Analysis - Nick Peralez - Senior Product Analyst.pptx for a concise overview of findings and recommendations.
	2.	Python Notebook:
	•	Use AOFL_Interview.ipynb to review the analysis process, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
	3.	Tableau Workbook:
	•	Open Tableau AOFL.twb to explore interactive dashboards. Validate results by comparing to Python outputs in the notebook.
	4.	Cleaned Data:
	•	Use cleaned_data.csv as the primary dataset for replication or further analysis.
	5.	Raw Data:
	•	Refer to raw files for initial data exploration and as reference for preprocessing steps.

Notes for Reviewers
	•	Tableau Discrepancies: Tabs marked red indicate minor differences between Python and Tableau outputs. These were due to rounding differences or minor formula variations.
	•	Code Documentation: The Python notebook is fully commented, explaining each step in the analysis process.
	•	Presentation Focus: The slides are tailored to engage both technical and non-technical stakeholders, emphasizing storytelling with data.
