Age of Learning Pilot Data Analysis - Nick Peralez

Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Senior Product Analyst position at Age of Learning. It showcases a comprehensive analysis of the pilot program data, aimed at evaluating the impact of My Math Academy and My Reading Academy on student engagement and skill growth. The project combines Python scripts, Tableau visualizations, and a polished presentation to communicate key insights and actionable recommendations for a district-wide rollout.

Presentation

Age of Learning Pilot Data Analysis - Nick Peralez - Senior Product Analyst.pptx
This professional presentation summarizes the pilotâ€™s outcomes, engagement trends, skill growth analysis, and actionable recommendations. It is designed for a 20-25 minute discussion with time for Q&A.

Python Analysis

AOFL_Interview.ipynb
The Jupyter Notebook contains data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualizations. Key metrics such as total skills mastered, percentage skill growth, and usage patterns are calculated and displayed using scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts, and outlier identification.

Tableau Workbook

Tableau AOFL.twb
This Tableau workbook includes interactive dashboards to validate Python analysis and provide additional insights. Tabs marked in red indicate unresolved discrepancies between Tableau and Python outputs due to time constraints.

Cleaned Data

cleaned_data.csv
This is the final dataset resulting from preprocessing in Python, including the removal of duplicates and handling of missing values. It was used consistently for Python and Tableau analyses.

Raw Data

The raw datasets provided for the analysis include:
Age of Learning Student Usage.csv
Age of Learning Student Dimensions.csv
Age of Learning Skills by Domain.csv

Project Instructions

Age of Learning Analytics Update Dec 2024.docx
This document outlines the original project guidelines, key metrics, objectives, and purpose of the analysis.

Key Highlights

Data Cleaning and Preparation

The preprocessing phase addressed duplicates and missing values and created additional metrics such as skills_mastered_per_week and total_skill_growth.

Key Insights

Engagement was high during the pilot, with consistent weekly logins. Skill growth was significant in high-impact domains like Measurement, though there is room for improvement in foundational language. Outliers were identified among students with high growth and low usage, as well as those with low growth and high usage.

Actionable Recommendations

The recommendations include increasing post-placement engagement, refining curricula in low-performing domains, and monitoring outliers for targeted interventions.

How to Use

Open the presentation file to view a concise overview of findings and recommendations. Use the Jupyter Notebook (AOFL_Interview.ipynb) to review the detailed analysis process, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The Tableau workbook (Tableau AOFL.twb) contains interactive dashboards to complement the Python analysis, and the cleaned data file (cleaned_data.csv) is available for replication or additional analysis. Refer to the raw files for comparisons or further exploration.

Notes for Reviewers

Tabs marked red in the Tableau workbook highlight discrepancies between Tableau and Python outputs. These differences are due to rounding or minor formula variations but do not impact overall conclusions. The Python notebook is fully documented, and the slides are tailored for both technical and non-technical audiences to emphasize storytelling with data.
